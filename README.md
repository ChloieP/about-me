About Me
3/21: Originally a Pair Programming assignment from week 1, I did this during week 2 on my own as I continue to play catch up from my late admittance into the Apprenti program. 

Game Rules:
Questions 1-5 require only a simple yes or no response.
Question 6 is a numerical response with an initial attempt and 3 additional attempts.
Question 7 is a word response with 3 possible correct answers. First letter capitalization does not matter. There are 6 additional attempts after the initial attempt.
Good luck!
